### Optimized for all vault sizes

The plugin automatically adapts to your vault size and provides excellent performance:

- **Single-Pass Efficiency**:
  - Simplified indexing processes all notes in one optimized pass
  - Frequent cache saves (every 50 files) prevent data loss
  - UI remains responsive with intelligent yielding every 5 files
  - Real-time progress display with current file information

- **Memory Optimization**:
  - Uses minimal memory per document (~1KB per 1000 notes)
  - Automatic sampling for large vaults to maintain performance
  - Smart cache management with periodic persistence
  - Optimized bloom filter sizes based on vault characteristics

- **Intelligent Processing**:
  - Automatic stopword detection for any language
  - Filename inclusion for better matching accuracy
  - Incremental updates for modified files
  - Debounced processing to handle rapid file changes

Whether you have 100 notes or 100,000 notes, the plugin delivers fast, accurate suggestions.

- `npm run dev:custom` - Starts development build with custom target directories (set TARGET_DIRS env var)
- `npm run build` - Creates a production build
- `npm run build:test` - Creates a production build and copies files to test-vault
- `npm run build:custom` - Creates a production build with custom target directories (set TARGET_DIRS env var)
- `npm run version` - Updates version numbers in manifest.json and versions.json

### Project structure

- `src/main.ts` - Main plugin file with core functionality and event handling
- `src/core.ts` - Core similarity algorithms and interfaces
- `src/bloom.ts` - Bloom filter implementation for efficient similarity calculation
- `src/multi-bloom.ts` - Multi-resolution bloom filter with adaptive parameters
- `src/settings.ts` - Settings tab implementation
- `src/ui.ts` - User interface components for related notes view
- `src/styles.css` - Custom CSS styles for the plugin
- `src/manifest.json` - Plugin manifest file
- `package.json` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `esbuild.config.mjs` - Build configuration for esbuild that handles copying files

### Key dependencies

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Copy the built files to your Obsidian plugins folder
```bash
# For testing with the included test-vault
npm run dev:test

# For testing with custom vault locations
TARGET_DIRS='["path/to/vault1/.obsidian/plugins/related-notes", "path/to/vault2/.obsidian/plugins/related-notes"]' npm run dev:custom
```

Alternatively, you can manually copy the following files to your Obsidian plugins folder:
- `main.js`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Plugin freezes or becomes unresponsive

If the plugin freezes during indexing or becomes unresponsive, especially in large vaults (5,000+ notes):

**Quick Recovery Steps:**

1. **Force-quit Obsidian** completely (not just close the window)
2. **Remove the plugin cache** by deleting the cache directory:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your vault's .obsidian folder and run:
   rm -rf .obsidian/plugins/related-notes
   ```
   Or manually delete the `.obsidian/plugins/related-notes` folder
3. **Restart Obsidian**
4. **Reinstall the plugin** from Community Plugins
5. The plugin will rebuild its index automatically with optimizations for large vaults

**Alternative Recovery (Preserve Settings):**

If you want to keep your plugin settings:
1. Force-quit Obsidian
2. Delete only the cache files:
   ```bash
   # In your vault's .obsidian/plugins/related-notes/ folder:
   rm -f .bloom-filter-cache.json
   rm -f bloom-filter-cache.json  
   rm -f similarity-cache.json
   ```
3. Restart Obsidian

### Index corruption issues

If you see errors like "Array length mismatch" or "Cache format incompatibility":

- The plugin automatically detects and fixes these issues
- If problems persist, follow the cache deletion steps above
- The plugin will rebuild with the correct format

### Performance in large vaults

For vaults with 10,000+ notes:

- The plugin uses single-pass indexing with intelligent optimizations
- Initial indexing completes in one efficient pass
- Automatic sampling keeps performance excellent even in massive vaults
- Use the "Clear Cache" and "Rebuild Index" buttons in settings if needed
- Monitor progress in the status bar with real-time file information

### Memory issues

If Obsidian becomes slow or uses excessive memory:

1. Close other resource-intensive applications
2. Restart Obsidian to clear memory
3. Consider adjusting the "Maximum Suggestions" setting to a lower number
4. Use the progressive indexing feature for very large vaults
