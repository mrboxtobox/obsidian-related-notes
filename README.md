- 📊 Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for accurate similarity matching
- 🎯 Configurable similarity threshold for fine-tuned suggestions
- 📝 Shows similarity scores for each related note
- 🔗 Quick "Add Link" button to reference related notes
- 💾 Persistent caching for improved performance
- ⚡ Real-time updates as you edit notes
