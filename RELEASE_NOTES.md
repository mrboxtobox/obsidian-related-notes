## 🚀 Major Version 2.0.0 - "Simplified Excellence"

This major release represents a complete architectural overhaul focused on **simplicity, performance, and reliability**. We've eliminated complex multi-phase indexing in favor of a streamlined single-pass approach that delivers better performance across all vault sizes.

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 🔧 Simplified Architecture
- **Single-Pass Indexing**: Replaced complex progressive indexing with one optimized pass
- **Eliminated Complexity**: Removed multi-phase processing that could cause issues
- **Better Reliability**: Simplified codebase means fewer edge cases and more stability
- **Cleaner Code**: Easier to maintain and debug

### ⚡ Performance Enhancements
- **Optimized Memory Usage**: More efficient memory handling for large vaults
- **Faster Startup**: Single-pass approach reduces initialization complexity
- **Smart Caching**: Frequent cache saves (every 50 files) prevent data loss
- **Responsive UI**: Intelligent yielding every 5 files keeps Obsidian responsive
- **Real-Time Progress**: Live display of current file being processed

### 🎯 Enhanced User Experience
- **Better Status Display**: Shows current file being indexed in hover text
- **Improved Settings**: Reorganized settings with clear sections
- **Exhaustive Debug Info**: Comprehensive troubleshooting information
- **Support Integration**: Built-in "Buy Me a Coffee" support button

### 🌐 Language & Compatibility
- **Universal Language Support**: Excellent CJK script handling
- **Filename Integration**: Includes note titles in similarity matching
- **Smart Tokenization**: Advanced text processing with technical term preservation
- **Mobile Ready**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile usage

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### Architecture Simplification
- Removed progressive indexing complexity
- Single MultiResolutionBloomFilterProvider handles all processing
- Eliminated race conditions and timing issues
- Streamlined event handling and file updates

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Automatic optimization for large vaults (10,000+ notes)
- **Debounced Processing**: Handles rapid file changes efficiently
- **Cache Management**: Persistent storage with smart invalidation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint even for massive vaults

### Developer Experience
- **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and README updates
- **Simplified Debugging**: Enhanced debug information with system details
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden surprises for curious users 🎮
- **Clean APIs**: Simplified interfaces and consistent patterns

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors from signature mismatches
- Resolved `isLargeVault is not defined` reference errors
- Eliminated progressive indexing-related race conditions
- Fixed cache corruption issues with format validation
- Improved error handling throughout the codebase

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Vault Size | Indexing Time | Memory Usage | UI Responsiveness |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| < 1,000    | < 30 seconds  | ~1MB         | Excellent         |
| 1K - 5K    | 1-3 minutes   | ~5MB         | Excellent         |
| 5K - 20K   | 3-10 minutes  | ~20MB        | Good              |
| 20K+       | 10+ minutes   | ~50MB        | Good (with sampling) |

## 🔄 Migration from v1.x
