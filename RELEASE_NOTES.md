# Related Notes Plugin Release Notes

*These release notes were generated by Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant.*

## Version 2.0.0 (Upcoming)

### Major Algorithm Upgrade

- **New Optimized MinHash-LSH Implementation**: Complete rewrite of the similarity algorithm
  - Significantly faster similarity calculations (10-100x speed improvement)
  - Better support for large vaults (10,000+ notes) without UI lag
  - More relevant matches with word-level shingles instead of character-level
  - Enhanced memory efficiency using TypedArrays and optimized data structures

### Technical Improvements

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Uses Uint32Array for signature storage instead of regular arrays
  - Efficient bucket hashing for faster candidate retrieval
  - Optimized memory usage across large document collections
  - Better caching and garbage collection

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Row-based minhash implementation (avoids computing hashes over entire vocabulary)
  - Fast hash functions using (a*x + b) mod p approach
  - Batched processing with proper yielding to main thread
  - Parallel processing where possible

- **Code Quality**:
  - Comprehensive test suite for algorithm verification
  - Performance benchmarking suite for optimization validation
  - Better TypeScript typing and interface definitions
  - Improved error handling and edge case management

### Feature Improvements

- **Better Recommendations**:
  - More contextually relevant matches with word-level shingles
  - Better handling of technical and domain-specific terms
  - Refined semantic similarity calculations
  - Improved common term extraction

- **Stability**:
  - Reduced UI lag during indexing operations
  - More responsive UI with optimized yielding strategies
  - Better progress reporting during initialization
  - Enhanced error recovery

## Version 1.0.0

### Smart Note Suggestions
- Automatically identifies semantically related notes based on content similarity
- Shows up to 20 related notes (configurable) in a dedicated sidebar
- Displays common terms between notes to explain why they're related
- Adaptive similarity detection for both small and large vaults

### Performance Optimizations
- Hybrid indexing approach for large vaults
- Priority-based indexing for frequently accessed notes
- On-demand computation for less frequently used notes
- Smart caching to improve performance and reduce processing time
- Incremental updates that only process changed files

### User Interface
- Clean, minimalist design that integrates with Obsidian's aesthetic
- Dedicated sidebar view with intuitive controls
- Status bar indicator showing indexing progress
- One-click linking to create connections between related notes
- Comprehensive settings tab with configuration options

### Settings & Configuration
- Adjustable maximum suggestions slider (1-20 notes)
- Toggle for detailed memory and NLP statistics
- Force re-indexing option with progress reporting
- Cancel button for stopping long-running operations

### Technical Highlights
- Deferred initialization to minimize impact on Obsidian startup time
- Sophisticated tokenization system with special handling for code blocks and technical terms
- Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient similarity computation
- Adaptive parameters that adjust based on vault size
- Persistent caching between sessions for faster startup
- Main thread optimization to keep the UI responsive during processing
- Improved CSS architecture with styles moved from inline JavaScript to CSS classes for better theme compatibility
