We're excited to announce the first stable release of the Related Notes plugin for Obsidian! This plugin uses advanced NLP techniques to suggest related notes based on content similarity, helping you discover connections in your knowledge base.

## Key Features

### Smart Note Suggestions
- Automatically identifies semantically related notes based on content similarity
- Shows up to 20 related notes (configurable) in a dedicated sidebar
- Displays common terms between notes to explain why they're related
- Adaptive similarity detection for both small and large vaults

### Performance Optimizations
- Hybrid indexing approach for large vaults (10,000+ notes)
- Priority-based indexing for frequently accessed notes
- On-demand computation for less frequently used notes
- Smart caching to improve performance and reduce processing time
- Incremental updates that only process changed files

### User Interface
- Clean, minimalist design that integrates with Obsidian's aesthetic

- Comprehensive settings tab with configuration options

### Settings & Configuration

## Technical Highlights

- Deferred initialization to minimize impact on Obsidian startup time

- Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient similarity computation
- Adaptive parameters that adjust based on vault size
- Persistent caching between sessions for faster startup
- Main thread optimization to keep the UI responsive during processing

## Bug Fixes
